Support_Vector_Machines

- In "math_summary.pdf" we consider the case of overlapping data and give a short math summary of the steps that lead to the computation of the "optimal margin linear boundary" and the "optimal margin gaussian kernel boundary".

- In "smo_class.ipynb" we build a class which reproduces the Sequential Minimal Optimization algorithm and computes the support vectors for optimal margin boundaries.

- In "noisy_moons_kernel_classifier.ipynb" we find a classifier that separates data that cannot be separated by a linear classifier.
